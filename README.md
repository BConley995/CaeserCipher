A simple Python script that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain amount to encrypt or decrypt a message.

## Features

- Supports both encryption and decryption of messages.
- Handles input messages with lowercase letters.
- Allows customizable shift amount.
- Provides an ASCII art logo for added visual appeal.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to choose the cipher operation (encode or decode), enter the message, and specify the shift amount.

4. The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed.
